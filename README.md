To install make the `install.sh` executable with `sudo chmod +x install.sh` then run with `./install.sh` and it will do everything else for you. **NOTE:** to uninstall follow the process above but just replace `install.sh` with `remove.sh` so it looks like `sudo chmod +x remove.sh` and run with `./remove.sh`.

This utility with execute on system boot after you install it. if you preffer you can do the process manually with the commands
contained inside the `install.sh` file. Is very useful when you have a laptop or dedicated machine that runs as a webserver, or
for when you want to turnoff your machine when it has no network connection.

modify and use for your own purposes as needed.
